division time ==> 2h for yeasts in YPD, depends medium and mutation
biodiversity ==> probability of having mutated cells
mutation rate ==> change rate of diversity
power of antibiotic ==> represents both efficiency and quantity of antibiotic used
probability of having a antibioresistant cell ==> could be equal to biodiversity
life span of cells
size of cell ==> 0, point-like objects
medium ==> contains homogeneously the antibiotic can change division time and quantity of antibiotic
